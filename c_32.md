* We will learn about the JSON data structure which can be used to store and access data. 
* Will learn what is an API and how an API call be made to the service and desired data extracted from it. 
* Will use an API call to change the background of the game depending on the time of the day at a specified place. 
* Will also build the scoring system in the game.

API [ [click here to know more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) ]

* API calls are very similar to ordering food. 

* Instead of ordering food, we order a web server to give  some information using API calls. 

* Different Web Servers provides with different types of API calls and "Promise" of information. 

* We need not know how these web servers serve this information but we can still use them in our application. 

* All major tech companies provide API services - you can request them to provide you some information programmatically over an API call. 

* For example, you can ask Amazon to list you all the products listed as "Xbox". **API** stands for **Application programming interface**.

*  In this class we will learn to make simple API calls.

  STEP:

  1. Let's use a simple API called worldtimeapi.
     * It gives the time of any specified location on the planet. 
     * We can use our browser to make a simple API call. 
     * Enter - http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/A sia/Tokyo on  browser. 
     * You can change the continent and the city to different values: Asia/Kolkata Europe/London etc.
     * There is a lot of information. There is something called ‘datetime’ which tells us the date and the time with very high precision.
     * Do you recognize the format in which the data is shown here? 
     * We have used this before - while storing options for our rectangular body. 
     * This is called JSON data structure.
     * A JSON structure can hold multiple values inside { }. Each value is indexed by a name. For example, here the date and time value is indexed by the name "datetime" here.
     *  We will soon learn how to use the index to access the value in a JSON.

2. Let's learn how to programmatically call an API. 

   * We will use the time information we get from this API to make our game a little more dynamic. 

   * Currently the Angry Birds game takes place with a day background.

   *  Let's get the hour of the day information.

   *  If it is daytime, we will keep a day time background. If it is night time, we will keep a night time background.

   *  write a function called getTime() to get the time of the day by making an API call.

     ```
     // write a function called getTime() in sketch.js,to get the time of the day by making an API call.
     
     
     function getTime()
     {
     
     }
     ```

     * We can call an API using fetch(). fetch() sends a request to the API service and collect the response. 

     * Let's call this API using fetch and collect the response in a variable

       ```
       
       function getTime()
       {
       var response = fetch("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Tokyo");
       }
       ```

       

3. Making an API call involves some network requests and takes a little time. 
   * However, Javascript executes this synchronously. It means that it executes one line after the other. It will not wait for the ‘fetch API call’ to be completed before moving to the next line. 
   * However, we want it to wait for the API call to be completed. We do this by adding await before fetch(). It tells the computer to wait for the API call to be completed before moving to the next lines.

***asynchronous function - a function which waits for some lines to be completed before jumping to the next line. We must tell the computer that getTime() is an async function so that it knows what to do.***

```
async function getTime()
{
var response = await fetch("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Tokyo");
}


```



4. The response contains a promise of the data. We need to extract the json response out of it. We use the json() function to do this. We can also log this on our console to see what it contains.

```
async function getTime()
{
var response = await fetch("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Tokyo");


var = responseJSON = await response.json();
console.log(responseJSON);

}
```

5. If you want to extract the datetime from the json data, you can just log responseJSON.datetime This is how values in JSON data structure are accessed using their index.

```
console.log(responseJSON.datetime);
```

6. The datetime contains both the date and time with great precision in string format. 
   * Let's say we just wanted the hour information. 
   * What could we do? 
   * Each character in a string is indexed by its position.
   *  They can be sliced by their index positions to create a new string. 
   * The hour information is present between 11th to 13th character.

```
Note: Check reference on how slice() works. Each number within datetime is considered one character.

var datetime = responseJSON.datetime;
var hour = daytime.slice(11,13);


```

7. There are some very cool APIs out there; like Weather API which tells the weather of any particular place, twitter API using which you can find any tweet and several other APIs.

8. Define a variable bg to store the background. Write the code to change the background depending on the hour of the day. 

   * If it is 1900 hrs to 0600 hrs, keep a night background. If it is 0600 hrs to 1900 hrs, keep a day background.

   * write the async function getBackgroundImg() which fetches the datetime information and extracts the hour information.

   *  It then chooses a background image depending on the hour of the day.

     **var bg = "sprites/bg1.png";**

     ```
     async function getBackgroundImg()
     {
     var response = await fetch("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Tokyo");
     
     
     var = responseJSON = await response.json();
     console.log(responseJSON);
     
     var datetime = responseJSON.datetime;
     var hour = daytime.slice(11,13);
     
     if(hour>=06 && hour<=19)
     {
     bg ="sprites/bg.png";
     }
     else
     {
     bg = "sprites/bg2.jpg"
     }
     
     backgroundImg = loadImage(bg);
     console.log(backgroundImg);
     }
     ```

     

   * call the getBackgroundImg() function inside preload()

```
function preload()
{
getBackgroundImg();
}
```

9.  code so that the background() function is executed only if the background image is defined. Check what happens otherwise!!

   ```
   
   function draw()
   {
   if(backgroundImg)
   background(backgroundImg);
   }
   ```

   

10.  build the scoring system:

    **var score = 0;**

    ```
    noStorke();
    textSize(35);
    fill("white");
    text("SCORE :"+score,width-300,50);
    
    ```

    

11. write the function score() inside pig.js 
    * The score should keep increasing for each frame after the pig is hit till a certain score. 
    * increase the score as the visibility of the pig reduces.

```
score()
{
if(this.Visibility<0 && this.Visibility>-1005)
{
score++ ;
}
}
```

12.  call the score function for each of the pig object created in the game.

    ```
    pig1.display();
    pig1.score();
    pig3.display();
    pig3.score();
    ```
